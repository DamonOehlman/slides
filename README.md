Some might say this is taking things too far, but I say DRY.

## Um, What?

This is a collection of core talk material that is designed to be consumed and used in [my talks](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/talks) through using [shazam](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/shazam).  It's very early days for shazam so I wouldn't recommend trying this unless you are a trained professional or insane.
